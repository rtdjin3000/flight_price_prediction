# The error "image build failed" suggests that there is an issue with the build process.
# To fix it, let's go through the Dockerfile step by step and make the necessary corrections.

FROM python:3.7
# The base image looks correct, no changes needed.

COPY ./app /app
# Added a space between the source and destination paths, as they were concatenated together without a separator.

WORKDIR /app
# The working directory is set correctly.

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Installed the required dependencies using pip.

EXPOSE $PORT
# EXPOSE instruction should specify the port number directly instead of using an environment variable.
# To fix this, let's change it to the specific port number. Assuming the first exposed port should be used.

EXPOSE 8000
# Exposed the desired port, in this case, 8000.

CMD gunicorn --workers=4 -bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
# Fixed the typo in the "bind" argument, it should be "bind" instead of "-".
bind# Also, changed "$PORT" to "8000" to specify the correct port to bind.
# Assuming the second "app" refers to the app module name.

CMD gunicorn --workers=4 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
# Corrected the typo and specified the correct port in the CMD command.
